First, I worried I won't make it to the goal.
So I focus on things in my control and be at peace with things beyond.
Then I worried I'm not going the right direction.
So I teach myself there are many paths to achieve the goal and I gotta keep at it.
Then I realize mankind were never meant to save the Earth.
So I procreate, and consume, and breath, and excrete.
Without morality, I am free.
