I make development plans and technical design for software projects that are used by many people around the world. In my spare time, I help people learn how to code. I also attend hackathon events in either LA or Bay Area from time to time. My guilty pleasures are sci-fi novels (Neuromancer, Ready Player One, Dark Matter, among other titles) and podcasts.
