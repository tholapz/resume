I help create several web applications which are used by hundreds of thousands of users world wide. I graduated from University of Southern California in 2013 with the Master's degree in Computer Science. In my spare time, I attend hackathon events in either LA or Bay Area. Apart from that, I read about Startup and History. My current book is Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
